For any population of published results, there is a population of power values of the statistical tests on which conclusions are based. We give exact theoretical results showing how suppression of non-signiﬁcant results (publication bias) aﬀects the distribution of statistical power in a heterogeneous population of signiﬁcance tests. In a set of large-scale simulation studies, we compare four methods for estimating population mean power, based only on signiﬁcant results. The methods are maximum likelihood, extensions of of p-curve and p-uniform, and a new method we call z-curve. The versions of p-uniform and pcurve we consider perform well when eﬀect size is a single ﬁxed value, and under heterogeneity in sample size. When there is substantial variability in eﬀect size as well as sample size, both methods fail. If the assumptions of maximum likelihood are satisﬁed, it is the most accurate method of estimation under most conditions. When the assumptions of maximum likelihood are incorrect, z-curve is better. We describe and validate a conservative bootstrap conﬁdence interval that makes it possible to use z-curve with smaller samples of studies.},

We reviewed 222 meta-analyses to describe the prevalence of publication bias tests, and further identified 29 that met inclusion criteria for effect size extraction. Descriptive data reveal that 58\% of meta-analyses (n = 128) documented no effort to test for possible publication bias, and analyses of 72 difference statistics revealed that published studies were associated with significantly larger effect sizes than unpublished studies (d = 0.64). Exploratory moderator analyses revealed that effect size metric was a significant predictor of the difference between published and unpublished studies.},

The idea of a bilingual advantage may result from a publication bias favoring studies with positive results over studies with null or negative effects. To test this hypothesis, we looked at conference abstracts from 1999 to 2012 on the topic of bilingualism and executive control. We then determined which of the studies they reported were subsequently published. Studies with results fully supporting the bilingual-advantage theory were most likely to be published, followed by studies with mixed results. Studies challenging the bilingual advantage were published the least. This discrepancy was not due to differences in sample size, tests used, or statistical power. A test for funnel-plot asymmetry provided further evidence for the existence of a publication bias.},

Publication bias, outcome reporting bias, and a combination of these were generated. Egger’s regression test and the Funnel Plot test were extended to three-level models, and possible cutoffs for the estimator of the Trim and Fill method were explored. Furthermore, we checked whether the combination of results of several methods yielded a better control of Type I error rates. Results show that no method works well across all conditions and that performance depends mainly on the population effect size value and the total variance.},

	abstract = {Scientific methods of investigation offer systematic ways to gather information about the world; and in the field of psychology application of such methods should lead to a better understanding of human behavior. Instead, recent reports in psychological science have used apparently scientific methods to report strong evidence for unbelievable claims such as precognition. To try to resolve the apparent conflict between unbelievable claims and the scientific method many researchers turn to empirical replication to reveal the truth. Such an approach relies on the belief that true phenomena can be successfully demonstrated in well-designed experiments, and the ability to reliably reproduce an experimental outcome is widely considered the gold standard of scientific investigations. Unfortunately, this view is incorrect; and misunderstandings about replication contribute to the conflicts in psychological science. Because experimental effects in psychology are measured by statistics, there should almost always be some variability in the reported outcomes. An absence of such variability actually indicates that experimental replications are invalid, perhaps because of a bias to suppress contrary findings or because the experiments were run improperly. Recent investigations have demonstrated how to identify evidence of such invalid experiment sets and noted its appearance for prominent findings in experimental psychology. The present manuscript explores those investigative methods by using computer simulations to demonstrate their properties and limitations. The methods are shown to be a check on the statistical consistency of a set of experiments by comparing the reported power of the experiments with the reported frequency of statistical significance. Overall, the methods are extremely conservative about reporting inconsistency when experiments are run properly and reported fully. The manuscript also considers how to improve scientific practice to avoid inconsistency, and discusses criticisms of the investigative method.},

Interpretation should be cautious, given that it is not possible to separate different mechanisms of bias (classic publication bias, selective analysis, and fabrication) that lead to an excess of significance and in some fields significance-related biases may follow a complex pattern (e.g. Proteus phenomenon and occasional preference for ‘‘negative’’ results). Likelihood ratio estimates can be used to generate the post-test probability of bias, and correcting effect estimates for bias is possible in theory, but may not necessarily be reliable.},

A frequent criticism of meta-analysis is that it may be based on a biased sample of all studies that were done. In this paper, we use selection models, or weighted distributions, to deal with one source of bias, namely, the failure to report studies that do not yield statistically significant results. We apply selection models to two approaches that have been suggested for correcting the bias. The fail-safe sample size approach calculates the minimum number of unpublished studies showing nonsignificant results that must have been carried out in order to overturn the conclusion reached from the published studies. The maximum likelihood approach uses a weighted distribution to model the selection bias in the generation of the data and estimates various parameters of interest. We suggest the use of families of weight functions to model plausible biasing mechanisms to study the sensitivity of inferences about effect sizes. By using an example, we show that the maximum likelihood approach has several advantages over the fail-safe sample size approach.},

	abstract = {Summary. It is perhaps underappreciated that ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a significant cause of mortality in the UK. The only curative treatment is an emergency operation and quantifying the success of this presents many difficulties. In particular, there is empirical evidence of reporting bias, suggesting that studies failing to report operating theatre mortality may be those where death in theatre is more common. We suggest a procedure for correcting for this bias and re-examine a recent meta-analysis of the available data. This casts considerable doubt on some conclusions from naïve analyses that do not take into account the potential bias. Perhaps most importantly, our procedure indicates a modest improvement in operating theatre mortality over the last 50 years, which is a trend that is not evident from the usual naïve analyses.},

	abstract = {Background What are the parenting behaviors that shape child compliance? Most research on parent-child interactions relies on correlational research or evaluations of “package deal” interventions that manipulate many aspects of parenting at the same time. Neither approach allows for identifying the specific parenting behaviors that shape child compliance. To overcome this, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed available evidence on the effects of experimentally manipulated, discrete parenting behaviors—a niche in parent-child interaction research that contributes unique information on the specific parenting behaviors that shape child behavior. Methods We identified studies by systematically searching databases and through contacting experts. Nineteen studies (75 effect sizes) on four discrete parenting behaviors were included: praise, verbal reprimands, time-out, and ignore. In multilevel models, we tested for each parenting behavior whether it increased child compliance, including both observed and parent-reported measures of child compliance. Results Providing “time-out” for noncompliance robustly increased both observed and parent-reported child compliance (ds = 0.84–1.72; 95\% CI 0.30 to 2.54). The same holds for briefly ignoring the child after non-compliance (ds = 0.36–1.77; 95\% CI 0.04 to 2.90). When observed and parent-reported outcomes were combined, but not when they were examined separately, verbal reprimands also increased child compliance (d = 0.72; 95\% CI 0.26 to 1.19). Praise did not increase child compliance (ds = –0.27–1.19; 95\% CI –2.04 to 1.59). Conclusion Our findings suggest that of the discrete parenting behaviors that are experimentally studied in multiple trials, especially time-out and ignore, and to some extent verbal reprimands, shape child compliance.},

Richard Light and David Pillemer have developed both general guidelines and step-by-step procedures that can be used to synthesize existing data. They show how to apply quantitative methods, including the newest statistical procedures and simple graphical displays, to evaluate a mass of studies and combine separate data sets. At the same time, they insist on the value of qualitative information, of asking the right questions, and of considering the context in which research is conducted. The authors use exemplary reviews in education, psychology, health, and the policy sciences to illustrate their suggestions.Written in nontechnical language and addressed to the beginning researcher as well as to the practicing professional, Summing Up will set a new standard for valid research reviews and is likely to become a methodological classic.},

I argue that the test is unnecessary because publication bias exists almost everywhere as property of the research process, not individual studies. Furthermore, for several reasons, the test does not support the claims made on its behalf. Instead of focusing on testing sets of experiments for publication bias, we should focus on changes to scientific culture to reduce the bias.},

	abstract = {Objective: To systematically review methodological articles which focus on nonpublication of studies and to describe methods of detecting and/or quantifying and/or adjusting for dissemination in meta-analyses. To evaluate whether the methods have been applied to an empirical data set for which one can be reasonably conﬁdent that all studies conducted have been included. Study Design and Setting: We systematically searched Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, for methodological articles that describe at least one method of detecting and/or quantifying and/or adjusting for dissemination bias in meta-analyses.
Results: The literature search retrieved 2,224 records, of which we ﬁnally included 150 full-text articles. A great variety of methods to detect, quantify, or adjust for dissemination bias were described. Methods included graphical methods mainly based on funnel plot approaches, statistical methods, such as regression tests, selection models, sensitivity analyses, and a great number of more recent statistical approaches. Only few methods have been validated in empirical evaluations using unpublished studies obtained from regulators (Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency).
Conclusion: We present an overview of existing methods to detect, quantify, or adjust for dissemination bias. It remains difﬁcult to advise which method should be used as they are all limited and their validity has rarely been assessed. Therefore, a thorough literature search remains crucial in systematic reviews, and further steps to increase the availability of all research results need to be taken. Ó 2016 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We introduce the weighted likelihood bootstrap (WLB) as a way to simulate approximately from a posterior distribution. This method is often easy to implement, requiring only an algorithm for calculating the maximum likelihood estimator, such as iteratively reweighted least squares. In the generic weighting scheme, the WLB is first order correct under quite general conditions. Inaccuracies can be removed by using the WLB as a source of samples in the sampling-importance resampling (SIR) algorithm, which also allows incorporation of particular prior information. The SIR-adjusted WLB can be a competitive alternative to other integration methods in certain models. Asymptotic expansions elucidate the second-order properties of the WLB, which is a generalization of Rubin's Bayesian bootstrap. The calculation of approximate Bayes factors for model comparison is also considered. We note that, given a sample simulated from the posterior distribution, the required marginal likelihood may be simulation consistently estimated by the harmonic mean of the associated likelihood values; a modification of this estimator that avoids instability is also noted. These methods provide simple ways of calculating approximate Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities for a very wide class of models.},

	abstract = {Meta-analyses play an important role in synthesizing evidence from diverse studies and datasets that address similar questions. A major obstacle for meta-analyses arises from biases in reporting. In particular, it is speculated that findings which do not achieve formal statistical significance are less likely reported than statistically significant findings. Moreover, the patterns of bias can be complex and may also depend on the timing of the research results and their relationship with previously published work. In this paper, we present an approach that is specifically designed to analyze large-scale datasets on published results. Such datasets are currently emerging in diverse research fields, particularly in molecular medicine. We use our approach to investigate a dataset on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that covers 1167 results from case-control studies on 102 genetic markers. We observe that initial studies on a genetic marker tend to be substantially more biased than subsequent replications. The chances for initial, statistically non-significant results to be published are estimated to be about 44\% (95\% CI, 32\% to 63\%) relative to statistically significant results, while statistically non-significant replications have almost the same chance to be published as statistically significant replications (84\%; 95\% CI, 66\% to 107\%). Early replications tend to be biased against initial findings, an observation previously termed Proteus phenomenon: The chances for nonsignificant studies going in the same direction as the initial result are estimated to be lower than the chances for nonsignificant studies opposing the initial result (73\%; 95\% CI, 55\% to 96\%). Such dynamic patters in bias are difficult to capture by conventional methods, where typically simple publication bias is assumed to operate. Our approach captures and corrects for complex dynamic patterns of bias, and thereby helps generating conclusions from published results that are more robust against the presence of different coexisting types of selective reporting.},

	abstract = {Cohen (1962) pointed out the importance of statistical power for psychology as a science, but statistical power of studies has not increased, while the number of studies in a single article has increased. It has been overlooked that multiple studies with modest power have a high probability of producing nonsignificant results because power decreases as a function of the number of statistical tests that are being conducted (Maxwell, 2004). The discrepancy between the expected number of significant results and the actual number of significant results in multiple-study articles undermines the credibility of the reported results, and it is likely that questionable research practices have contributed to the reporting of too many significant results (Sterling, 1959). The problem of low power in multiple-study articles is illustrated using Bem’s (2011) article on extrasensory perception and Gailliot et al.’s (2007) article on glucose and self-regulation. I conclude with several recommendations that can increase the credibility of scientific evidence in psychological journals. One major recommendation is to pay more attention to the power of studies to produce positive results without the help of questionable research practices and to request that authors justify sample sizes with a priori predictions of effect sizes. It is also important to publish replication studies with nonsignificant results if these studies have high power to replicate a published finding.},

	abstract = {Background: Networks of trials assessing several treatment options available for the same condition are increasingly considered. Randomized trial evidence may be missing because of reporting bias. We propose a test for reporting bias in trial networks.
Methods: We test whether there is an excess of trials with statistically significant results across a network of trials. The observed number of trials with nominally statistically significant p-values across the network is compared with the expected number. The performance of the test (type I error rate and power) was assessed using simulation studies under different scenarios of selective reporting bias. Examples are provided for networks of antidepressant and antipsychotic trials, where reporting biases have been previously demonstrated by comparing published to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data.
Results: In simulations, the test maintained the type I error rate and was moderately powerful after adjustment for type I error rate, except when the between-trial variance was substantial. In all, a positive test result increased moderately or markedly the probability of reporting bias being present, while a negative test result was not very informative. In the two examples, the test gave a signal for an excess of statistically significant results in the network of published data but not in the network of FDA data.
Conclusion: The test could be useful to document an excess of significant findings in trial networks, providing a signal for potential publication bias or other selective analysis and outcome reporting biases.},

	abstract = {Publication bias is a substantial problem for the credibility of research in general and of meta-analyses in particular, as it yields overestimated effects and may suggest the existence of non-existing effects. Although there is consensus that publication bias exists, how strongly it affects different scientific literatures is currently less well-known. We examined evidence of publication bias in a large-scale data set of primary studies that were included in 83 meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin (representing meta-analyses from psychology) and 499 systematic reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR; representing meta-analyses from medicine). Publication bias was assessed on all homogeneous subsets (3.8\% of all subsets of meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin) of primary studies included in meta-analyses, because publication bias methods do not have good statistical properties if the true effect size is heterogeneous. Publication bias tests did not reveal evidence for bias in the homogeneous subsets. Overestimation was minimal but statistically significant, providing evidence of publication bias that appeared to be similar in both fields. However, a Monte-Carlo simulation study revealed that the creation of homogeneous subsets resulted in challenging conditions for publication bias methods since the number of effect sizes in a subset was rather small (median number of effect sizes equaled 6). Our findings are in line with, in its most extreme case, publication bias ranging from no bias until only 5\% statistically nonsignificant effect sizes being published. These and other findings, in combination with the small percentages of statistically significant primary effect sizes (28.9\% and 18.9\% for subsets published in Psychological Bulletin and CDSR), led to the conclusion that evidence for publication bias in the studied homogeneous subsets is weak, but suggestive of mild publication bias in both psychology and medicine.},
