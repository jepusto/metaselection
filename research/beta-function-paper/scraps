A_{ij} = A(\mathbf{x}_{ij}, \sigma_{ij}; \boldsymbol\beta, \tau^2, \boldsymbol\lambda) = \alpha_1^{\lambda_1} (1 - \alpha_1)^{\lambda_2} B_{0ij} + E_Y(1 | \lambda_1,\lambda_2) + \alpha_2^{\lambda_1} (1 - \alpha_2)^{\lambda_2} B_{2ij}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:beta-function-Ey}
E_Y\left[f(Y)| \lambda_1, \lambda_2\right] = \int_{\sigma_{ij} \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha_2)}^{\sigma_{ij} \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha_1)} f(Y) \left[\Phi(-Y / \sigma_{ij})\right]^{\lambda_1} \left[\Phi(Y / \sigma_{ij})\right]^{\lambda_2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\eta_{ij}}}\phi\left(\frac{Y - \mu_{ij}}{\sqrt{\eta_{ij}}}\right) dY,

Figure \@ref(fig:comparison-coverage-miss) shows the coverage rates of 95% confidence intervals based on large-sample cluster-robust variance approximations for the three models^[Once again, the vertical axis of Figure \@ref(fig:comparison-coverage-miss) is restricted to the range [0.5, 1.0], and coverage rates of the intervals based on 3PSM and 4PSM are not depicted when they fall below 0.5. Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:comparison-coverage-full-miss) depicts the full range of coverage rates.]
Coverage rates fall below the nominal 0.95 level for all three selection models across most conditions. However, the beta-function selection model generally achieves higher coverage than the step-function selection models, particularly when heterogeneity is moderate to large ($\tau \geq 0.3$), or when heterogeneity is low ($\tau \leq 0.15$), average effect size is small ($\mu \leq 0.2$), and number of studies ($J$) is 60 or more. As with CHE-ISCW and PET/PEESE, the confidence intervals produced by the step-function selection models are often miscalibrated, due in part to underestimated standard errors, which result in overly narrow intervals. Among the step-function selection models, coverage is generally higher for 4PSM than for 3PSM.
